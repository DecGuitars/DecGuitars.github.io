<p><indent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a company built on the notion that an instrument should be unique, one of a kind, and one to call your own. That's why we believe
   your guitar should be exactly how you want it. Comfort is the most important thing when playing an instrument. Having a comfortable guitar while being ergonomic is the essence of having the musician be one with the guitar.
    That is why we believe in hand crafting the perfect guitar for you. Working with you to get it the way you want it is our number one priority.
